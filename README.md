# MoviesShowApp
The project is accessing the API of TMDB to get movies and represent it and I added more features like: reviews and put movies into favourite list.\
I accessed TMDB API using retrofit library.\
I Applied Client-Server architecture as I made a RESTful webservice to store data into local database json files.\
Branch Main is the client side and Branch service-branch is the server side.\
I created the webservice using jersy library and published it on tomcat local server.\
I stored data like the IDs of favourite movies, manage users login verification, upload users'photos and
store reviews.
