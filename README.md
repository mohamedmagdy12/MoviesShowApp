# MoviesShowApp
The project is accessing the API of TMDB to get movies and represent it and I added more features like: reviews and put movies into favourite list.\\
I Applied Client-Server architecture as I made a RESTful webservice to store the IDs of favourite movies, manage users login verification, upload users'photos and
store reviews.\\
I created the webservice using jersy library and published it on tomcat local server.\\
I accessed TMDB API using retrofit library.\\
# Attatched a demo and screenshots from the project.
